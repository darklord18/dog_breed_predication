Dog Breed Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks
I have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model tailored for identifying three distinct dog breeds: the Scottish Deerhound, Maltese Dog, and Bernese Mountain Dog. 
This model leverages the power of deep learning and image recognition to accurately classify images of these breeds.
